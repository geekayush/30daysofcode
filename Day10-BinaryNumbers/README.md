## Objective 
Today, we're working with binary numbers.

## Task 
Given a base-10 integer, n, convert it to binary (base-2). Then find and print the base-10 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1's in n's binary representation.

## Input Format
```
A single integer, n.
```

## Constraints
<code>
1<=n<=10<sup>6</sup>
</code>

## Output Format
```
Print a single base-10 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the binary representation of n.
```

## Sample Input 1
```
5
```

## Sample Output 1
```
1
```

## Sample Input 2
```
13
```

## Sample Output 2
```
2
```

## Explanation

Sample Case 1: 
The binary representation of 5 is 101, so the maximum number of consecutive 1's is 1.

Sample Case 2: 
The binary representation of 13 is 1101, so the maximum number of consecutive 1's is 2.
