## Objective 
In this challenge, you'll work with arithmetic operators.

## Task 
Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost.

Note: Be sure to use precise values for your calculations, or you may end up with an incorrectly rounded result!

## Input Format

There are 3 lines of numeric input: 
The first line has a double, meal_cost (the cost of the meal before tax and tip). 
The second line has an integer, tip_percent (the percentage of  being added as tip). 
The third line has an integer, tax_percent (the percentage of  being added as tax).

## Output Format

Print the total meal cost, where total_cost is the rounded integer result of the entire bill (meal_cost with added tax and tip).
