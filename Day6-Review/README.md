# Day 6 - Review

## Objective 
Today we're expanding our knowledge of Strings and combining it with what we've already learned about loops.

## Task 
Given a string, S, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N-1, print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).

Note: 0 is considered to be an even index.

## Input Format
```
The first line contains an integer, T (the number of test cases). 
Each line i of the T subsequent lines contain a String, S.
```

## Constraints
```
1<=T<=100
2<=length of S<=10000
```

## Output Format
```
For each String, S, print it's even-indexed characters, followed by a space, followed by it's odd-indexed characters.
```

## Sample Input
```
2
Hacker
Rank
```

## Sample Output
```
Hce akr
Rn ak
```
